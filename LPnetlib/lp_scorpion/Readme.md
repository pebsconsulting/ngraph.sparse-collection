 A Netlib LP problem, in lp/data.  For more information

 The following are relevant excerpts from lp/data/readme (by David M. Gay):

                                                                           

 The column and nonzero counts in the PROBLEM SUMMARY TABLE below exclude  

 slack and surplus columns and the right-hand side vector, but include     

 the cost row.  We have omitted other free rows and all but the first      

 right-hand side vector, as noted below.  The byte count is for the        

 MPS compressed file; it includes a newline character at the end of each   

 line.  These files start with a blank initial line intended to prevent    

 mail programs from discarding any of the data.  The BR column indicates   

 whether a problem has bounds or ranges:  B stands for "has bounds", R     

 for "has ranges".                                                         

                                                                           

 The optimal value is from MINOS version 5.3 (of Sept. 1988)               

 running on a VAX with default options.
